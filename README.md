### This repository contains my code and analysis for the curious tale of the lost AGU book chapter.

During Summer 2021 I wrote a book chapter with Julienne Stroeve about "Sea Ice Trends, Variability and Extremes", for an AGU Geophysical Monograph called "Earth's Climate and Weather: Dominant Variability and Disastrous Extremes". We wrote this 6000 word chapter and produced nine bespoke figures which you can find here. We sent the chapter off and it was peer-reviewed by two reviewers. The reviewers gave what I would describe as somewhere between minor and major revisions. Both of their reviews were good: thoughtful and constructive. We worked hard to respond to them, and resubmitted the book chapter by the end of February 2022. Noteably, all the figures had to be produced in such a way that they could be produced in colour and black-and-white, which took considerable planning.

Two months after resubmitting what I think was a very nice chapter, I received the following!

Dear Contributors,

Reference is made to the agreement dated January 4, 2022 (the “Agreement”) between Jialin Lin, et al.
(the “Contributor”) and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 111 River Street, Hoboken, NJ 07030-5774 (the
“Publisher”) for and on behalf of the American Geophysical Union (the “Society”). Although the
preamble to the Agreement was not completed at the time of signing, the Contributor acknowledges
and agrees that the Agreement refers to a Contribution to be included in a Work tentatively entitled
Earth’s Climate and Weather: Dominant Variability and Disastrous Extremes (the “Work”).

1. This letter serves as formal written notice that the Publisher is hereby terminating the
Agreement with immediate effect pursuant to Section 6 as the Publisher will not be publishing
the Work.

3. Effective upon receipt hereof, the Agreement is hereby terminated. The Contributor on the one
hand and the Publisher and the Society on the other hand shall have no further obligation or

There was then a followup email to all authors:

```
From: Scholl, Summers <sscholl@wiley.com>
Date: Monday, March 14, 2022 at 9:18 AM
To: Lin, Jialin <lin.789@osu.edu>
Cc: Jenny Lunn <jlunn@agu.org>
Subject: Follow up regarding Earth’s Climate and Weather

Dear Dr. Lin,
 
On behalf of Wiley, allow me to apologize for the communications surrounding your book project,Earth’s Climate and
 Weather: Dominant Variability and Disastrous Extremes.  I am part of the Wiley team, including Noel McGlinchey and
 Lesley Fenske, working on the AGU publishing partnership—picking up from Dr. Ritu Bose, with whom you began this
 project.  I understand from Dr. Kate Lajtha that, based on the review of the submitted manuscript chapters, the AGU
 has decided to remove your project from their portfolio.  I was briefed on the communications by Wiley and AGU to you
 and regret if, at any time, communications were sub-optimal. 
 
I appreciate that a lot of hard work went into this project, but having read the reviews, responses, and current state
 of key chapters, I must inform you that Wiley will also decline to publish the volume.  Our decision falls under
 Section 1.5 of your publishing agreement.  I’m truly sorry we could not move forward to publication.  While our decision
 is final, if you would like to speak more about it, I can offer a call among AGU and Wiley this week.  If I don’t hear
 from you on or before March 17, I’ll assume you do not wish to have that call. 
 
I will be sending you a formal termination letter, and your contributors will be notified of their rights to publish elsewhere.
 
Best regards,
Summers

### The lesson here is *do not write a book chapter* unless you are certain the book will be published! Even if there are many highly capable scientists on the list of authors, the book will succeed or fail depending on the *least capable* (since it is the lowest quality chapters that dictate the decision to move forward).
