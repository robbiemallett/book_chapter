### This repository contains my code and analysis for the curious tale of the lost AGU book chapter.

During Summer 2021 I wrote a book chapter with Julienne Stroeve about "Sea Ice Trends, Variability and Extremes", for an AGU Geophysical Monograph called "Earth's Climate and Weather: Dominant Variability and Disastrous Extremes". We wrote this 6000 word chapter and produced nine bespoke figures which you can find here. We sent the chapter off and it was peer-reviewed by two reviewers. The reviewers gave what I would describe as somewhere between minor and major revisions. Both of their reviews were good: thoughtful and constructive. We worked hard to respond to them, and resubmitted the book chapter by the end of February 2022. Noteably, all the figures had to be produced in such a way that they could be produced in colour and black-and-white, which took considerable planning.

Two months after resubmitting what I think was a very nice chapter, I received the following!

Dear Contributors,

Reference is made to the agreement dated January 4, 2022 (the “Agreement”) between Jialin Lin, et al.
(the “Contributor”) and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 111 River Street, Hoboken, NJ 07030-5774 (the
“Publisher”) for and on behalf of the American Geophysical Union (the “Society”). Although the
preamble to the Agreement was not completed at the time of signing, the Contributor acknowledges
and agrees that the Agreement refers to a Contribution to be included in a Work tentatively entitled
Earth’s Climate and Weather: Dominant Variability and Disastrous Extremes (the “Work”).

1. This letter serves as formal written notice that the Publisher is hereby terminating the
Agreement with immediate effect pursuant to Section 6 as the Publisher will not be publishing
the Work.

3. Effective upon receipt hereof, the Agreement is hereby terminated. The Contributor on the one
hand and the Publisher and the Society on the other hand shall have no further obligation or
liability to each other in connection with the material, the Work or the Agreement. All rights
transferred or assigned to the Society under the Agreement automatically and immediately
revert to the Contributor absolutely.
As specified in the Agreement, the parties consent to execution and delivery of this termination letter
electronically and the parties agree that an electronic signature will be given the same legal force as a
handwritten signature.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

There was then a followup email to all authors:

```
Dear All,
 
I realize this news may be surprising and certainly disappointing.  In view of all the hard work that went into the book, the decision not to publish was not made lightly.  Allow me to explain:
 
In the course of reviewing the submitted chapters, AGU determined that several chapters required revision.  The opportunity to revise was given to the responsible authors, but unfortunately, even after such revision, the subsequent versions remained unacceptable. Issues included scientific inaccuracies, conceptual disorganization, under- and over-citation, substandard analyses, and lack of clarity in figures.  These issues, and the significance of these chapters, particularly their critical role in framing the book and supporting other chapters, led to the decision not to publish.  AGU initially communicated the decision to remove the book from the AGU imprint to Dr. Lin in February.  Wiley was briefed on AGU’s review process and communications.  In light of AGU’S decision not to publish, which was based on the status of these key chapters, and the fact that the chapters were still not of a publishable quality, Wiley also decided not to publish the volume.  Dr. Lin’s contract specifically states, in part, that “[i]n the event that the Publisher determines that the necessary revisions would be so extensive and fundamental that a satisfactory and timely revision would not be feasible, the Publisher shall have the right to deem the Work unsatisfactory without requesting changes and to terminate the Agreement.” 
 
I’m sorry we could not find a way to publication, especially for such an important topic involving so many high caliber scientists.  You will be sent letters reverting the rights to your chapters back to you and you may, of course, submit them for publication elsewhere as you see fit.  If you would like AGU to send the full review packet for your chapter to another publisher (i.e., the editorial contact for journals or books), please email books@agu.org. 
 
Best regards,
Summers

### The lesson here is *do not write a book chapter* unless you are certain the book will be published! Even if there are many highly capable scientists on the list of authors, the book will succeed or fail depending on the *least capable* (since it is the lowest quality chapters that dictate the decision to move forward).
